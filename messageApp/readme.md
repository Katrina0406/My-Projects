- Open the entire folder in your compiler
- Type in python3 manage.py runserver
- The app will be started, and then paste the url server address (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8000) on the terminal to a webserver.
- Add destination to the page you want to go using a slash + name format. (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8000/lstm guides you to the page with the tag lstm). The tag after the server address (webname) can be found in the template folder).
